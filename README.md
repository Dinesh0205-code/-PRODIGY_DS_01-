### Prodigy infotech data science internship Task 1:

create bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continous variable such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population

### Dataset
The dataset used for this task is world_population_dataset

### Tools and Libraries used
.Jupyter notebook
.pandas
.Numpy
.Matplotlib & seaborn for visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1 Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2 Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

 
  ### Visualizing Data Distributions with Bar Charts

In data science, understanding the distribution of variables is crucial for insightful analysis. One effective way to visualize this distribution is through bar charts. Bar charts are particularly useful for displaying the frequency or count of categorical variables (like gender) and summarizing continuous variables (like age) when binned into ranges.

#### **Why Use a Bar Chart?**

- **Categorical Variables**: For variables like gender, where the data can be divided into distinct categories (e.g., Male, Female, Non-Binary), bar charts offer a straightforward way to compare the number of occurrences in each category. This helps in quickly identifying patterns or imbalances within the dataset.
  
- **Continuous Variables**: When dealing with continuous variables such as age, it's often beneficial to bin the data into ranges (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, 21-30). Bar charts can then show how many data points fall into each range, providing a clear visual representation of the distribution.

#### **Example: Age Distribution**

For instance, if you have a dataset of individuals with their ages recorded, you can bin ages into intervals like 0-10, 11-20, and so forth. By creating a bar chart with these bins on the x-axis and the number of individuals in each bin on the y-axis, you get a clear picture of how age is distributed within the population.

#### **Example: Gender Distribution**

In the case of a dataset that includes gender information, a bar chart can display the count of individuals for each gender category. This visual can help identify gender proportions and potential biases in the dataset

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.
